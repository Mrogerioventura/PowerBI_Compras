# PowerBI_Compras

#### This Dashboard was developed to demonstrate my ability to use Microsoft's Power BI tool, Version 2.118.621.0 32-bit (June 2023).

#### The database (Base_Compras.xlsx), with data from the year 2020, was worked on to be able to generate insights and subsequently have the data ready for the development of the Dashboard, referring to the Purchasing sector.

#### For this development, a macro evaluation of the variables was started, to then develop more detailed ones, following a Top-Down principle of data sampling, generating insights for the company's purchasing sector .

#### Thus, initially we have the Total Spending on purchases, accompanied by the Product most purchased by the company, highlighting two values of extreme importance for the business team.

#### Next, we can check in the column chart and follow-up over time, specifically in this case, the months of the year 2020, the Total Original value, that is, the expected value for purchase, and in the column on the side, the Total amount with Discount.

#### Further down to the left, you can check the states where the products were purchased and their respective first Suppliers, Value with Discount and quantity of goods purchased in that state.

#### Finally, on the right, there is a list of suppliers and the respective amounts paid to each one of them.

#### According to the interaction capacity provided by the Microsoft tool, we can interact with all the graphs, and the others adapt to the choices made by the user, providing a true interaction and countless possibilities to obtain new insights, in addition to the observed during the development of the work.
